# *Innovate. Aspire. Share*

Welcome to **Non-Discrete Software**.

If you are reading this, you aren't just a user—you are a potential **innovativEngineer**. You are here because the content, the rigid, modular software, video games, and streaming services of the last century no longer serves you. You are looking for more than just a system to store data, you are looking for a new paradigm that *thinks* about it.  You are looking for an integrative and immersive experience that game-ifies the user interface and purposes whatever functionality you determine resonates with your world. 

Welcome to **EajR**.

We are building **etherWare**—a cognitive infrastructure where the User Interface isn't a dashboard, but a brain in collaboration with YOU. It creates neural connections between your data, your tools, and your intent. Whether you need a Generative Architect, a Quantum Physicist, or a Digital Companion, etherWare adapts to become exactly what you need.

EajR is proposing more than software. It is a **Partnership**.

### **The Endeux-Aspirons Model**

We don't believe in passive consumption. We believe in shared innovation. Our business model, **Endeux-Aspirons**, is built on a simple promise: **If you help us build it, you share in the profit.**

We are opening our R&D labs to *you*.

**How it Works:**
1.  **Innovate:** You have an idea. You build a **Minimally Viable Proof of Concept (MVPOC)**—a Jupyter Notebook, a README with references, and a flattened no-build frontend in html.
2.  **Submit:** You submit your proposal to our **Access Lottery** on GitHub.
3.  **The AI Chooses:** We don't pick favorites. Our AI evaluates the submissions and selects the next project to enter our flight deck.
4.  **We Build:** If selected, EajR develops your concept in-house. We train the models on our  **DGX Spark** units, quantize them for edge deployment, and release them to the community via direct access to our Github.  Access is purchased via Patreon.
5.  **You Earn:** Every time a user pays for access to download that tool via Patreon, **you get a percentage of the profit.**

### **The Current Flight Deck**

By becoming a Patron today, you aren't just supporting a concept, you are participating. You are gaining access to the tools currently in active development on our DGX units:
* **🧬 Protoforge:** A generative AI that "grows" 3D structures using spatial reasoning.
* **⚛️ BQCD:** A biomimetic toolkit for designing robust quantum circuits.
* **🖐️ MIMIC:** A "Creole" language interface that lets you control simulations with hand gestures.
* **👁️ Precept:** An AI Auditor that watches the watchers, ensuring our systems don't hallucinate.

### **Why Join?**

This Patreon is your key to the city.
* **Direct Access:** Membership grants you the credentials to unlock the etherWare repositories, download the code to use however you choose.
* **The Lottery:** Only members can submit proposals to the Access Lottery.
* **The Inner Circle:** Get behind-the-scenes access to our **innovativEngineer Micro-Vlog**, where we interview the creators behind the code and offer unique perspective into our thought process.

Innovate.  Aspire.  Share.  Let's augment your world, together. **Ready?**
